# Shopping-Manager
This project is a coursework assignment aimed at implementing an online shopping system management program. The program consists of both a console-based interface for the manager and a graphical user interface (GUI) for the users.

# --Overview--
The project is divided into three main phases:

Design and Class Implementation (Phase 1): In this phase, the system's design was created using UML diagrams, and classes were implemented according to object-oriented principles. The class hierarchy includes Product, Electronics, Clothing, User, ShoppingCart, and WestminsterShoppingManager.

Console Menu Implementation (Phase 2): The WestminsterShoppingManager class was developed to display a menu in the console for management actions such as adding new products, deleting products, printing product lists, and saving product lists to a file.

Graphical User Interface (GUI) Implementation (Phase 3): The GUI was implemented to allow users to interact with the system, visualize products, add them to the shopping cart, and view the final price with discounts applied.
